# Conventions for spin- and colour-correlated Born quantities

This page connects the notation of the
[MadNkLO colour-correlator note](https://github.com/mg5amcnlo/pyamplicol/blob/main/IMPLEMENTATION_DOCS/REFERENCES/ColorCorrelators_MadNkLO.pdf)
to pyAmpliCol's [correlated API](correlators.md). In particular, it makes the
bra/ket convention explicit: pyAmpliCol contracts the **adjoint of the bra
connection with the ket connection**, rather than adopting the note's
oriented, non-conjugated product unchanged.

The implementation gives LC, NLC and full-colour tree-level quantities,
evaluated at physical `N_c=3`. The order of a colour connection (NLO, NNLO,
N3LO) is independent of this colour approximation.

## Amplitudes, basis tensors, and correlated matrices

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `N_c = 3` | Number of colours, not the size of the colour basis |
| `c, d = 1, ..., N_basis` | Labels of the retained colour-basis tensors |
| `h` | External helicity configuration, or spectator helicities after spin replacement |
| `C_c` | A colour tensor, including its external colour indices |
| `A[h,c]` | The coherent, complex partial amplitude in the generated convention |
| `S_B`, `S_K` | Ordered colour connections applied on the bra and ket side |
| `N` | The ordinary overall normalization, including any factored common coupling, averaging, and identical-particle factors |

With momenta and model parameters left implicit, the definitions are:

```text
|M_h>       = sum_c A[h,c] |C_c>
K[B,K][c,d] = < S_B C_c | S_K C_d >
R[B,K]     = N sum_(h,c,d) conj(A[h,c]) K[B,K][c,d] A[h,d]
```

The matrix includes the process's colour normalization factors. Its entries
are evaluated exactly as complex rational numbers at generation. At runtime,
`R[B,K]` is returned as a `CorrelatedValue` with decimal real and imaginary
parts. The ID `"born"` uses empty connections, giving the usual colour metric
`<C_c|C_d>`.

Only spectator helicities are summed incoherently. Colour components are
combined **before squaring**, retaining their interference. Separate squared
flow/helicity components are therefore not sufficient to reconstruct a
general colour or spin correlation: their relative phases have been lost.

For two different connections, neither an individual colour matrix nor its
answer is assumed real or symmetric. Interchanging the bra and ket gives
the Hermitian-conjugate matrix and the complex-conjugate answer:

```text
K[K,B] = K[B,K]†
R[K,B] = conj(R[B,K])
```

At full colour, identical connections give a squared norm. This distinction
also explains why an ordered connection should not be interpreted as a
positive squared matrix element in every case.

## Colour accuracy

The selected `color.accuracy` applies to the correlated contraction, while the
complete generated amplitude basis is retained. Empty connections use the
existing ordinary colour-accuracy convention. The inserted matrix is built
with symbolic powers of `N_c` before its selected coefficients are evaluated
at three colours. Amplitude coefficients and incoming averages remain at
physical `N_c=3`: this is the inherited colour-matrix approximation, not a
new strict expansion of every part of the matrix element.

For a Born basis with `n_g` adjoints and `n_qbarq` fundamental pairs, and a
connection containing `r` operations of which `s` are gluon-to-quark-pair
splittings on either side, the common reference power is

```text
P = n_g + n_qbarq + r - s.
```

LC keeps powers at least `P`. For purely adjoint final colour space, NLC
keeps powers at least `P-2`. With fundamental lines, NLC retains the exact
coefficient of an entry if its highest nonzero power is at least `P-2`, as
in the ordinary open-line approximation. Intervening odd powers are included.
Full colour retains all terms. The threshold is common to related connections,
not reset to each entry's leading nonzero term. Born-metric zeros are not used
to discard connected entries, and intermediate splitting terms are not pruned.

Coherence and Casimir tests at approximate colour accuracy compare terms
through the retained order. Keeping exact admitted NLC coefficients can leave
residuals below that order; it does not imply exact finite-`N_c` cancellation
of those extra terms. Full-colour identities hold without that truncation.
LC/NLC matrices are approximations and are not generally positive operators.

## Colour charges, indices, and crossing

We use Hermitian physical generators with
`tr(t^a t^b) = T_R delta(a,b)`, `T_R = 1/2`, and
`[t^a,t^b] = i f^(abc) t^c`. In **output, input** index order the charges are:

| All-outgoing representation | Charge matrix for emitted gluon colour `a` |
| --- | --- |
| Quark, `3` | `t^a[out,in]` |
| Antiquark, `3bar` | `-t^a[in,out]` |
| Gluon, `8` | `-i f^(a,out,in)` |

These conventions give `C_F = (N_c^2-1)/(2 N_c) = 4/3` and `C_A = N_c = 3`.
Internally, some colour-ordered tensors use generators `tau = sqrt(2) t`;
the correlated matrices include that conversion. Do not supply an extra
factor of two or `sqrt(2)` at runtime.

All colour charges use the all-outgoing convention: an incoming quark is an
outgoing antiquark for the colour algebra, and vice versa. Leg **labels do not
change**: they remain one-based in the generated public process order,
including colourless particles. The caller supplies normal physical incoming
momenta and must not add another colour-crossing sign.

At NLO,

```text
B_ij = N sum_h <M_h | T_i . T_j | M_h>
     = N sum_(h,a) <T_i^a M_h | T_j^a M_h>
```

is requested as `ColorCorrelator.dipole("Tij", i, j)`. This is the quantity
multiplying soft eikonal factors in a factorized soft limit. pyAmpliCol does
not include the eikonal factor, its soft-limit sign, or the associated
`4 pi alpha_s` factor in `B_ij`. Diagonal entries are retained: their eikonal
coefficients vanish for massless legs but need not vanish for massive legs.

## Ordered connections and auxiliary labels

A connection is a chronological tuple of operations. If its entries are
`(E1, E2, ..., Em)`, its action on a ket is `S = Em ... E2 E1`:
the **first tuple entry acts first**. The bra is adjointed afterwards.
Operations on the same colour line generally do not commute.

`EmitGluon(i, x)` keeps emitter `i` and adds an adjoint leg `x`.
`SplitGluon(x, q, qbar)` removes an adjoint parent `x` and replaces it with
a fundamental leg `q` and an antifundamental leg `qbar`, through
`t^a[q,qbar]`. New labels must be fresh, including with respect to retired
parents. Born labels are positive and one-based; we recommend reserving fresh
negative labels for auxiliary partons, although the operation classes do not
enforce that sign convention. Auxiliary partons have **no additional Born
phase-space momenta**. A later operation may act on an auxiliary leg
only after that leg has been introduced.

The note's four connection classes have the following direct API counterparts:

| Class in the note | Chronological pyAmpliCol operations |
| --- | --- |
| A: emissions from different Born lines | `(EmitGluon(i, -1), EmitGluon(j, -2))`, `i != j` |
| B: successive emissions from one Born line | `(EmitGluon(i, -1), EmitGluon(i, -2))` |
| C: an emitted gluon emits another gluon | `(EmitGluon(i, -1), EmitGluon(-1, -2))` |
| D: an emitted gluon splits into a quark pair | `(EmitGluon(i, -1), SplitGluon(-1, -2, -3))` |

The algebra also permits splitting an active Born gluon. The note's
soft-connection class D instead starts with an already-emitted gluon which
can itself become soft; algebraic support for a Born-leg splitting does not
imply a soft singularity of that hard leg.

Thus the note's emission triple `(i, x, i)` becomes `EmitGluon(i, x)`.
For a quark-pair splitting, the API explicitly names the two daughter
representations and uses fresh daughter labels; it does not reuse the
parent label as one daughter. When translating a whole pair of connections,
relabel their final partons consistently on both sides.

Explicit declarations keep the ordered lists as supplied and use user-chosen
**string IDs for the requested pair**. The automatic catalogue described below
instead indexes canonical chronological histories. Neither form attaches
multiplicities to the result. In particular, do not apply the note's
descending-label sort to a chain whose next emitter has not yet been created.

Both sides must have the same order, with no fixed upper bound, and
finish with identical labelled colour representations. A gluon-only final
colour space cannot be contracted with a quark-pair colour space. Invalid
pairs are rejected rather than returned as physical zeroes. One-, two-, and
three-step connections supply NLO, NNLO, and N3LO colour structures; this is
not a claim to supply the kinematic ingredients of an N3LO calculation.

## Automatic generic catalogue

`CorrelatorConfig.all_color(through_order=k)` registers every compatible
ordered pair through orders 1,...,k, together with the ordinary Born. This is
the generic construction of section 2 of the MadNkLO note, not a list of
dipole products. Its soft scope permits gluon emission from any active
coloured leg and quark-pair splitting of auxiliary gluons, but not splitting
hard Born gluons automatically. The latter operation remains available
explicitly. Colour roles are crossed to the all-outgoing convention by the
generator, separately for each process.

Let `S_m` be the set of histories with m operations, starting with the identity
at m=0. From every history, append each allowed operation on every active leg.
Emitted gluons and the daughters of a quark-pair splitting are also active
emitters. Each operation increases the number of final auxiliary partons by
one. At order m, assign their labels in every possible way to `-1,...,-m`.
Retired intermediate parents receive separate dummy labels below `-m`.

The spanning argument is constructive. A leading tree-level QCD soft current
is a sum of forests rooted on the hard coloured lines. Its quark-gluon and
three-gluon colour vertices are precisely the two supported operations;
four-gluon colour factors are sums of products of two structure constants
and can be resolved into successive binary operations. A topological traversal
of any such forest is therefore visited by the recursion, including multiple
quark pairs and every assignment of the labelled soft partons. It follows that

```text
J_m^(0) = sum_alpha j_alpha S_alpha^(m)
N sum_h <M_h | J_m^(0)† J_m^(0) | M_h>
    = sum_(alpha,beta) conjugate(j_alpha) j_beta B_(alpha,beta)
```

where `B_(alpha,beta) = R[S_alpha,S_beta]` in the notation above,
with the unresolved-spin sums included when forming the physical squared
quantity. `N` is the common Born normalization defined above.
Chronological colour construction does **not**
assume strongly ordered soft energies: simultaneous-soft kinematics and
contact terms belong to the coefficients `j_alpha`. Flavour factors and
identical-fermion exchange signs also belong to the physical current.
This proves coverage of tree-soft colour tensors, not provision of loop
amplitudes or the kinematic ingredients of a complete fixed-order calculation.
For the factorization of the leading soft current see
[Catani and Cieri, section 2](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-10001-z);
the appearance of colour quadrupoles beyond dipoles at three soft gluons is
discussed by [Catani, Colferai and Torrini](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01616).

Canonicalization removes only independent chronological interleavings and
dummy-name choices. It preserves the order on each emitter line and every
creation-before-use dependency. In contrast to a blind descending-label sort,
the stored representative is always executable. Colour-conservation, Jacobi
and sign-related redundancies are retained; a minimal basis is not required.
Finally, pair **all** canonical histories of the same order with identical
final labels and representations. Both directed orders and self-pairs remain.
There are no numerical multiplicity factors on these individual entries.

Final-label assignments are essential even across different creation orders.
For example, these N3LO histories interfere in the same final space
`q(-1), qbar(-2), g(-3)`:

```python
left = (
    EmitGluon(1, -4), SplitGluon(-4, -1, -2), EmitGluon(-1, -3),
)
right = (
    EmitGluon(1, -3), EmitGluon(1, -4), SplitGluon(-4, -1, -2),
)
```

Number the sorted histories independently at each order, starting from zero.
The pair of history indices `(i,j)` at order r has ID `N{r}LO/c{i}/c{j}`.
These are local indices for a particular process catalogue, not universal
operator numbers or hashes. The full typed chronological `bra` and `ket`
records are stored with the ID; retired-label conventions do not require any
additional momenta. The available metadata is returned by
`runtime.available_color_correlations()`, including `"born"` at order zero.
The caller can inspect, select and combine entries without parsing ID strings.

No perturbative-order cap is imposed. Detailed physics tests cover NLO through
N3LO, with higher-order Casimir and two-pair checks. Enumeration tests compare
the NNLO classes A--D, preserve noncommuting histories, and verify N3LO
cross-order creation histories and N4LO two-pair relabelling. For n coloured
Born legs the NNLO catalogue has `(n*n + 3*n)**2 + 2*n*n` directed pairs:
108 for two legs and 816 for four. At N3LO four legs already give 90,720 pairs;
the full automatic option trades a larger output for not choosing a subset.

## Translating the note's non-conjugated convention

The note's sections 2.1-2.2 keep orientations in the connection labels and do
not conjugate the second connection. Our definition is instead
`<S_B M|S_K M>`. Although the NLO dipoles agree once index directions are
matched, beyond NLO one must translate the adjoint, the order of charges,
fundamental/antifundamental orientations, and final-parton labels together.
Copying two legacy connection IDs is not a defined conversion.

The quark-pair example is particularly useful. Let

```python
from pyamplicol import ColorCorrelator, EmitGluon, SplitGluon

pair = (EmitGluon(1, -1), SplitGluon(-1, -2, -3))
request = ColorCorrelator("pair-self", bra=pair, ket=pair)
```

The API's self-overlap is nonzero in general. At full colour, conjugation
pairs a fundamental index with its antifundamental partner and gives

```text
sum_(q,qbar) conj(t^a[q,qbar]) t^b[q,qbar] = T_R delta(a,b)
R[pair,pair] = T_R B_11
```

For a quark emitter this is `(1/2)(4/3) B = (2/3) B`; for a gluon emitter
it is `(1/2)(3) B = (3/2) B`, where `B` is the full-colour Born result.
For LC/NLC these identities apply through the retained colour order, rather
than as exact finite-`N_c` equalities between differently truncated matrices.
This is not the zero of the note's oriented `(D.1,D.1)` pairing: that pairing
does not represent the same adjointed contraction. With the generator
normalization above, the closed pair trace is `T_R delta(a,b)`, not
`C_F delta(a,b)`.

`SplitGluon` represents **one labelled quark flavour**. Neither a flavour sum
`n_f`, additional powers of the strong coupling, unresolved phase space,
kinematic splitting functions, nor unresolved-particle symmetry factors are
included. These belong to the application using the correlated Born.

## Products and anticommutators with a shared colour line

The note's double-soft example contains an anticommutator
`{A,B} = AB + BA`, with `A = T_2 . T_3` and `B = T_1 . T_2`.
The shared leg 2 makes the order important. In the API's adjointed convention,
one valid construction is:

```python
bra = (EmitGluon(3, -1), EmitGluon(1, -2))
ab = ColorCorrelator(
    "AB", bra=bra,
    ket=(EmitGluon(2, -2), EmitGluon(2, -1)),
)
ba = ColorCorrelator(
    "BA", bra=bra,
    ket=(EmitGluon(2, -1), EmitGluon(2, -2)),
)
# Include ab and ba in CorrelatorConfig.color_correlations before generation.
```

For `AB`, the ket acts as `T_2^a T_2^b`; the bra adjoint supplies
`T_1^b T_3^a`. Charges on different Born legs commute, giving
`T_2^a T_3^a T_1^b T_2^b = AB`, with `a,b` summed. Swapping the
ket operations gives `BA`, without commuting the charges on leg 2.

After generating and loading a runtime containing these IDs:

```python
from pyamplicol import CorrelatedRequest

values = runtime.evaluate_correlated_many(points, {
    "AB": CorrelatedRequest(color_correlation="AB"),
    "BA": CorrelatedRequest(color_correlation="BA"),
})
anticommutator = tuple(
    (x.real + y.real, x.imag + y.imag)
    for x, y in zip(values["AB"], values["BA"], strict=True)
)
```

There is no factor of `1/2` in this definition of the anticommutator.
When combining high-precision `Decimal` results, use a decimal context with
at least the requested precision. More general connection products should
likewise be built at the tensor level, not by multiplying two Born overlap
matrices: a nonorthogonal colour basis has a nontrivial metric, and a Born
basis need not remain closed under an insertion.

## Colour-coherence checks

For a full-colour, colour-conserving Born amplitude, the standard checks are

```text
sum_j B_ij = 0                       (sum includes j = i)
B_ii = C_i B                         (C_i = C_F or C_A)
sum_(j != i) B_ij = -C_i B
```

The sum runs over all coloured Born legs, with incoming charges already
crossed. A nontrivial connected tensor also obeys colour conservation, but
now the sum includes **all its current coloured legs**, including emitted
gluons or daughter quarks, but excluding a parent removed by a splitting.
This gives iterative checks at NNLO and N3LO.
One should not expect an unweighted sum over every distinct higher-order
connection to vanish: those entries describe different emission histories,
and sometimes different final colour spaces.

The note also groups histories in which only Born legs emit gluons, its
"abelian-like" subset. If commuting histories are collapsed to one canonical
representative, the missing ordering multiplicity must be restored. With
`m` emissions and `n_i` emissions on Born leg `i`, preserving the order on
each individual line, this multiplicity is `m! / product_i(n_i!)`.
At NNLO it is 2 for two distinct emitters and 1 for two emissions from the
same emitter; at N3LO the corresponding patterns give 6, 3, and 1.
These weights describe such a canonicalized sum; the API does not multiply
individual requested correlations by them. They apply only after identifying
genuinely equivalent labelled contractions: charges on a shared line must
not be commuted, and any relabelling of an auxiliary index must be made
consistently across the whole bra/ket contraction.

For example, interchanging `EmitGluon(i, -1)` with `EmitGluon(j, -2)`
commutes when `i != j` and their labels are kept attached to the same emitters.
Changing the assignment to `EmitGluon(j, -1)` and `EmitGluon(i, -2)` is a
different labelled map. Preserve these assignments, or define a consistent
symmetrization on both sides, before using a weighted higher-order coherence
sum from the note.

## Spin contractions and Ward identities

External spin states and vector components are four-dimensional. The API
does not supply a full `d = 4 - 2 epsilon` spin tensor or the
epsilon-dependent polarization averages of conventional dimensional
regularization.

For a declared external vector leg, the setter replaces its source by the
literal contravariant vector `(v0, vx, vy, vz)`, using metric `(+,-,-,-)`.
There is no normalization or transverse projection. In schematic notation,
if the amplitude is `v^mu M_mu`, the same vector on the ket and its complex
conjugate on the bra form the rank-one spin contraction. Distinct vectors on
several declared legs act jointly, not as a product of separate squared
matrix elements.

No extra average over the supplied vectors is introduced. Original incoming
spin/colour averages are retained, and unreplaced helicities are summed.
The usual two-polarization completeness sum recovers the unpolarized
massless-vector result. Scaling a single vector by `z` scales the answer by
`abs(z)**2`.

For a massless gauge boson, replacing its polarization by its momentum tests
the Ward identity with the other gauge legs in physical transverse states;
several momentum replacements are also allowed if their joint class was
declared. The vanishing is not guaranteed if another gauge leg is instead
given an arbitrary non-transverse source. This is a literal nonzero momentum
source, not its
projection onto physical helicities. A massive vector instead satisfies the
appropriate Goldstone relation; it is not subject to the same zero test.
The setter currently exposes rank-one contractions, not independent bra/ket
vectors or a general spin-density tensor.

See [Born Correlations](correlators.md) for runnable generation/evaluation
examples, vector batching, reset behaviour, and the exact execution scope.
