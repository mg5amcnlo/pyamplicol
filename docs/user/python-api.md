# Python API

The public Python interface offers typed services for model compilation,
process planning/generation, runtime evaluation, Born correlations, selectors,
and profiling.
Importing `pyamplicol` is lightweight: Symbolica and model tooling are loaded
only when the requested operation needs them.

```python
import pyamplicol

print(pyamplicol.__version__)
```

## Public service map

| Service | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ModelSource` | Resolve and compile built-in, JSON, UFO, compiled, or prepared models. |
| `Generator` | Plan or generate schema-v3 process artifacts. |
| `Runtime` | Load one concrete process and evaluate totals/resolved components. |
| `CorrelatorConfig`, `ColorCorrelator` | Declare allowed spin replacements and named colour operators at generation. |
| `CorrelatedValue` | A correlated result with `Decimal` real and imaginary parts. |
| `BenchmarkRunner` | Profile an artifact or loaded runtime. |
| `generate`, `load`, `benchmark` | One-shot convenience functions. |

The shipped scripts under
[`examples/python/`](https://github.com/mg5amcnlo/pyamplicol/tree/main/examples/python)
are complete runnable programs.

## Plan and generate with the built-in model

```python
from pyamplicol import GenerationConfig, Generator, ModelSource

generator = Generator(GenerationConfig(workers=2))
model = ModelSource.built_in_sm()

plan = generator.plan("d d~ > z g", model=model)
for process in plan.concrete_processes:
    print(process.name, process.expression)

result = generator.generate(
    "d d~ > z g",
    "artifacts/builtin_ddbar_to_zg",
    model=model,
    mode="replace",
)
print(result.output)
```

`plan()` resolves the model/process/color/evaluator contract without writing a
process artifact. `generate()` returns an immutable `GenerationResult` with the
absolute output, stored process set, schema version, and file inventory.

The packaged scalar HEFT model uses the same public selector:

```python
from pyamplicol import Generator, ModelSource

heft = ModelSource.built_in_sm_heft()
Generator().plan("g g > H g g", model=heft)
```

Use an explicit `HIG = 1` coupling-order limit in a resolved run configuration
when generating the process; see [Models and Processes](models-and-processes.md#built-in-scalar-heft-model)
and the packaged `builtin_sm_heft.toml` card.

## Generate a named process set

```python
from pyamplicol import Generator, ModelSource, ProcessRequest, ProcessSet

processes = ProcessSet(
    requests=(
        ProcessRequest.parse("u u~ > Z g", name="uubar_Zg"),
        ProcessRequest.parse("u u~ > Z g g", name="uubar_Zgg"),
    )
)

result = Generator().generate(
    processes,
    "artifacts/z_ladder",
    model=ModelSource.built_in_sm(),
    mode="replace",
)
```

Process names must be unique. For custom aliases and crossing metadata, use
`ProcessAlias`; runtime expression matching already handles unique
side-preserving permutations automatically.
The correlated reference path currently requires identity ordering; these
permutation facilities apply to ordinary evaluation.

## Compile and reuse an external model

```python
from pyamplicol import Generator, ModelSource

source = ModelSource.from_path(
    "models/json/sm/sm.json",
    restriction="default",
)
model = source.compile()

print(model.info.name)
print(model.capabilities.supported_color_accuracies)
print(model.supported)

Generator().plan("d d~ > z g", model=model)
```

For a trusted UFO directory:

```python
source = ModelSource.from_path(
    "/path/to/MyUFO",
    restriction="restrict_default.dat",
)
model = source.compile()
```

UFO modules execute Python while loading. See
[Models and Processes](models-and-processes.md) for trust, serialization, and
prepared bundles.

## Use a fully resolved run card

For complex configuration, resolve the same schema used by the CLI and pass the
result to `Generator`:

```python
from pyamplicol import Generator, ModelSource, ProcessRequest, ProcessSet
from pyamplicol.config import resolve_config

card = {
    "schema_version": 1,
    "action": "generate",
    "model": {"source": "models/json/sm/sm.json", "restriction": "default"},
    "process": {
        "entries": [{"expression": "p p > Z j j"}],
        "multiparticles": {"p": ["d", "d~", "g"], "j": ["d", "d~", "g"]},
        "flavor_scheme": 2,
        "max_quark_lines": 2,
    },
    "color": {"accuracy": "lc"},
    "generation": {"output": "artifacts/pp_zjj", "mode": "replace"},
    "evaluator": {"execution_mode": "compiled", "backend": "jit"},
}

resolution = resolve_config(card)
model = ModelSource.from_config(resolution.effective.model).compile()
processes = ProcessSet(
    tuple(
        ProcessRequest.parse(entry.expression, name=entry.name)
        for entry in resolution.effective.process.entries
    )
)
result = Generator(resolution).generate(
    processes,
    resolution.effective.generation.output,
    model=model,
    mode=resolution.effective.generation.mode,
)
```

The complete maintained implementation is
[`examples/python/typed_generation.py`](https://github.com/mg5amcnlo/pyamplicol/blob/main/examples/python/typed_generation.py).

## Load a runtime

```python
from pyamplicol import Runtime

runtime = Runtime.load(
    "artifacts/pp_zjj",
    process="d d~ > g z g",
    model_parameters={"aS": 0.117, "MZ": 91.1876},
)

print(runtime.artifact_id)
print(runtime.execution_mode)
print(runtime.physics.process_id)
print(runtime.physics.process)
print(runtime.representative_process_key)
print(runtime.external_permutation)
```

`process` may be a stable process ID, explicit alias ID, exact stored expression,
or unique permutation-equivalent expression within each side. The loaded
runtime exposes metadata in the requested public order.
For correlated evaluation, load the stored process in its generated ordering;
nonidentity aliases/permutations are not supported by that path yet.

## Evaluate totals and resolved components

```python
import json
import math
from pathlib import Path

points = json.loads(Path("data/pp_zjj_momenta.json").read_text())

totals = runtime.evaluate(points)
resolved = runtime.evaluate_resolved(points)

print(resolved.helicity_ids)
print(resolved.color_ids)
for optimized, explicit in zip(totals, resolved.total(), strict=True):
    assert math.isclose(optimized.real, explicit.real, rel_tol=1e-12, abs_tol=1e-15)
    assert math.isclose(optimized.imag, explicit.imag, rel_tol=1e-12, abs_tol=1e-15)
```

Input shape is:

```text
(point, external particle, [E, px, py, pz])
```

At LC, resolved shape is `(point, helicity, color_flow)`. At NLC/full,
the color dimension has length one because color is contracted.

## Evaluate Born correlations

Correlations require an explicit `Generator.generate(..., correlators=...)`
declaration. They support **LC, NLC and full colour**, through a separate Python
direct, generic compiled exact executor. `color.accuracy` selects the correlated
approximation. Supplying `correlators` retains complete underlying amplitudes
and selects direct contraction and compiled generation. Ordinary generation
and evaluation remain unchanged.

```python
from pyamplicol import (
    ColorCorrelator, CorrelatorConfig, Generator, ModelSource, Runtime,
)
from pyamplicol.config import ColorConfig, RunConfig

declarations = CorrelatorConfig(
    color_correlations=(ColorCorrelator.dipole("T13", 1, 3),),
    spin_correlations=((3,), (3, 4)),
)
generated = Generator(RunConfig(color=ColorConfig(accuracy="full"))).generate(
    "g g > g g", "artifacts/gg_correlated",
    model=ModelSource.built_in_sm(), correlators=declarations,
)
correlated_runtime = Runtime.load(generated.output)
point = (
    (500, 0, 0, 500), (500, 0, 0, -500),
    (500, 300, 0, 400), (500, -300, 0, -400),
)
colour = correlated_runtime.evaluate_correlated(
    (point,), color_correlation="T13", precision=40,
)[0]
correlated_runtime.set_spin_correlation_vectors({3: (0, 0, 1, 0)})
spin_colour = correlated_runtime.evaluate_correlated(
    (point,), color_correlation="T13", precision=40,
)[0]
print(spin_colour.real, spin_colour.imag)  # Decimal values, not a forced real part.
correlated_runtime.set_spin_correlation_vectors(None)
```

Instead of explicit colour requests, use
`CorrelatorConfig.all_color(through_order=k, spin_correlations=...)` before
generation to prepare every compatible directed pair of tree-soft connections
through any positive order `k`. The nonminimal catalogue includes emissions from
emitted partons and splitting of auxiliary gluons, and grows rapidly with order.
It adds no kinematic kernels, flavour sums or multiplicity weights. Inspect the
operators actually stored for a selected process with:

```python
for entry in correlated_runtime.available_color_correlations():
    print(entry.id, entry.order, entry.bra, entry.ket)
```

This includes `"born"` and reads the catalogue without initializing amplitude
evaluation. See the [automatic catalogue guide](../correlators.md)
for generation and grouped evaluation.

`evaluate_correlated(momenta, *, color_correlation="born", helicities=None,
precision=16, arithmetic="arbitrary")` returns one `CorrelatedValue` per point. The reserved ID
`"born"` uses the Born metric at the requested colour accuracy; other IDs are the declared
operators. Optional batch-global helicity selectors accept stable IDs or typed
`HelicityConfiguration` objects. There is no colour-flow or per-point selector
argument on this method. Normalization, initial-state averages, and
identical-particle factors are retained, and runtime model-parameter updates
also apply to correlations.

For multiple combinations, `evaluate_correlated_many(points, requests)` takes
a mapping from your result labels to `CorrelatedRequest(color_correlation=...,
spin_vectors=...)`. Its result is a dictionary of tuples:
`result[request_label][point_index].real` or `.imag` selects one contraction
at one phase-space point. Label and point order are preserved. Identical spin
assignments share their amplitudes across colour operators, and unchanged
stages can be reused across different assignments. See the
[two-axis example](../correlators.md#several-requests-and-several-phase-space-points)
for request-centric and point-centric access. Ordinary `evaluate()` on the
underlying correlated output remains full-colour; use the correlated `"born"`
request when comparing its selected LC/NLC approximation.

The spin-vector mapping uses one-based public leg labels. Each value is a
literal real or complex `(v0, vx, vy, vz)` vector, broadcast across the batch,
or one such vector per point. The nonempty key set must exactly match a
declared spin class: this example permits `{3}` and `{3, 4}`, but not `{4}`.
Vectors are neither normalized nor projected. They are copied into
instance-local state; a failed setter preserves the previous state. `None` or
`{}` resets to ordinary helicity sources; `clear()` releases warmed evaluators
without resetting vectors. The setter affects `evaluate_correlated` and
inherited requests in `evaluate_correlated_many`, not `evaluate` or
`evaluate_resolved`.

`Decimal` vector components retain their digits; a `(Decimal(real),
Decimal(imaginary))` pair represents one complex component without first
rounding it through Python's binary64 `complex`. For example:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

zero = Decimal(0)
correlated_runtime.set_spin_correlation_vectors({3: (
    zero, zero,
    (Decimal("1.0000000000000000000000001"), Decimal("2e-25")),
    zero,
)})
arb = correlated_runtime.evaluate_correlated((point,), precision=80)
dd = correlated_runtime.evaluate_correlated(
    (point,), arithmetic="double-double", precision=31,
)
correlated_runtime.set_spin_correlation_vectors(None)
```

The default is arbitrary precision. Explicit `arithmetic="double-double"`
uses genuine DoubleFloat arithmetic throughout sources, evaluation stages,
normalization and reduction; at most 31 result digits are supported. The same
keyword and Decimal vector syntax apply to `evaluate_correlated_many` and its
explicit request vectors. See the [grouped precision example](../correlators.md#decimal-inputs-and-double-double-arithmetic).

Artifacts without declarations, append generation, partial source coverage,
FFT, eager/recurrence/OTF correlated execution, replay reductions, and
nonidentity process permutations are not supported. Ordered `EmitGluon` and
`SplitGluon` operations have no fixed order cap; generic NkLO colour-connection
order is distinct from LC/NLC colour approximations and does not supply a
complete higher-order subtraction calculation. See [Born Correlations](../correlators.md)
for the bra-adjoint/ket convention, joint spin contractions, JSON declarations,
Ward checks, and current limitations.

The same generated colour catalogue and spin classes are available to the
[C/C++/Fortran/Rust SDKs](native-apis.md#correlated-born-evaluations), whose
correlated evaluation is binary64 and independent of Python/Symbolica.
The Python methods described here retain their precision-controlled executor.

## Select helicities and color flows

Batch-global selectors accept stable IDs or the typed objects exposed by
`runtime.physics`:

```python
selected = runtime.evaluate(
    points,
    helicities=[runtime.physics.helicities[0]],
    color_flows=[runtime.physics.color_flows[0]],
)
```

For one selector per point:

```python
mixed = runtime.evaluate(
    points,
    helicity_by_point=[
        runtime.physics.helicity_ids[index % 2]
        for index in range(len(points))
    ],
    color_flow_by_point=[
        runtime.physics.color_flow_ids[(index // 2) % 2]
        for index in range(len(points))
    ],
)
```

Batch-global and per-point selectors are mutually exclusive on the same axis.
Per-point color selection is LC-only. Rusticol groups mixed selectors while
returning values in original point order.

See [Runtime and Selectors](runtime-and-selectors.md) for the complete selector
contract.

## Update model parameters

```python
runtime.set_model_parameters({"aS": 0.1165, "MZ": 91.1876})
runtime.set_model_parameter("MT", 172.5)
```

Updates are atomic and refresh dependent derived parameters. Unknown,
immutable, non-finite, or invalid values reject the entire update.

`Runtime.load(..., model_parameters=...)` applies a complete mapping before the
runtime is returned. Complex inputs may be represented as Python complex values.

## Precision

```python
f64 = runtime.evaluate(points, precision=16)
high_precision = runtime.evaluate(points, precision=80)
```

For ordinary `evaluate` and `evaluate_resolved`, precision 16 uses the native
Rusticol runtime and does not import Symbolica. Other positive precision
requests use retained exact evaluator state when the artifact supports it and
load Symbolica lazily. Decimal input preserves the supplied decimal digits;
binary64 input cannot gain information merely by requesting more arithmetic
precision.

`evaluate_correlated` always uses retained Symbolica evaluator states through
the separate Python exact executor, including at its default precision 16.
Its default `arithmetic="arbitrary"` is distinct from the explicit
`arithmetic="double-double", precision=31` mode; neither is selected by an
ordinary native SDK precision flag.
Its real and imaginary results remain `Decimal` values; `complex(value)` is an
explicit conversion to ordinary double precision.

Generated C/C++/Fortran/Rust standalone APIs support f64 (`precision=16`) only.

## Profile from Python

```python
from pyamplicol import BenchmarkConfig, BenchmarkRunner

config = BenchmarkConfig(
    target_runtime=1.0,
    batch_size=128,
    precision=16,
    warmup_runs=2,
    minimum_samples=5,
    color_flow_ids=("1",),
)

result = BenchmarkRunner(config).run(runtime, points=points)
print(result.wall_time_per_point)
print(result.evaluator_time_per_point)
print(result.uncertainty.standard_error)
print(result.uncertainty.relative_standard_error)
```

`BenchmarkResult` also contains calibrated repetitions, sample count,
environment metadata, native timing breakdown, stage attribution, and work
counters when the runtime exposes them.

The runnable reference is
[`examples/python/benchmark.py`](https://github.com/mg5amcnlo/pyamplicol/blob/main/examples/python/benchmark.py).

## Convenience functions

```python
from pyamplicol import benchmark, generate, load

generated = generate(
    "d d~ > z g",
    "artifacts/builtin_ddbar_to_zg",
    model=ModelSource.built_in_sm(),
    mode="replace",
)
runtime = load(generated.output)
profile = benchmark(runtime, points=points)
```

The class-based services are preferable when reusing configuration, progress
sinks, compiled models, or loaded runtimes.
The one-shot `generate(...)` function also accepts the same
`correlators=CorrelatorConfig(...)` keyword as `Generator.generate(...)`.

## Errors

All public failures derive from `PyAmpliColError`:

```python
from pyamplicol import EvaluationError, GenerationError, PyAmpliColError

try:
    runtime = Runtime.load("artifacts/pp_zjj", process="missing")
except EvaluationError as error:
    print(f"could not load runtime: {error}")
```

Useful subclasses include configuration, model, generation, artifact,
compatibility, dependency, and evaluation errors. Catch the narrowest type you
can handle; catch `PyAmpliColError` at an application boundary.

## API design notes

- Public result and metadata objects are immutable dataclasses or typed facades.
- Artifact paths are normalized to absolute paths at service boundaries.
- `Generator.generate(..., mode="error")` refuses an existing destination.
- `Runtime` is bound to one selected process; load another instance for another
  process in the same multiprocess artifact.
- Process artifacts are trusted executable inputs. Normal loading validates the
  schema, path confinement, references, target compatibility, and runtime ABI.
- Use explicit payload validation only for an intentional whole-artifact
  corruption audit; it is not required before every load.
