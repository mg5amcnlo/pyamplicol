# Examples Gallery

The wheel ships runnable TOML cards, Python programs, model/data resources, and
native consumers. Copy them into an ordinary directory before experimenting:

```console
pyamplicol examples copy ./pyamplicol-examples --force
cd pyamplicol-examples
```

Paths inside a card are resolved relative to that card, so the copied workspace
can be moved without referring back to the installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the environment containing pyAmpliCol activated, or invoke its
> executables by explicit path. Generated native drivers discover the SDK
> through `rusticol-config` from that same environment.

## See what is available

```console
pyamplicol examples list
```

The command prints a colored table with each card stem, action, and one-line
description. Use `--json` when a script needs the same inventory as stable,
uncolored machine-readable output:

```console
pyamplicol examples list --json
```

A card can also run in a versioned private cache workspace:

```console
pyamplicol examples run evaluate_total
```

`examples run` accepts the stem shown by `examples list`; it is not an
arbitrary TOML path. Use the copied workspace when you want to edit cards,
inspect artifacts, or run several related steps.

## The four-command tour

The primary sequence generates a portable multiprocess `p p > Z j j` artifact
from the serialized UFO Standard Model, then evaluates and profiles one
subprocess:

```console
pyamplicol generate_pp_zjj_from_ufo_sm.toml
pyamplicol evaluate_total.toml
pyamplicol evaluate_resolved.toml
pyamplicol benchmark.toml
```

What each card demonstrates:

| Card | Demonstration |
| --- | --- |
| `generate_pp_zjj_from_ufo_sm.toml` | JSON model input, multiparticle expansion, compiled JIT O2, API bundle |
| `evaluate_total.toml` | Optimized total, model-parameter card, reordered process expression |
| `evaluate_resolved.toml` | Physical helicity/LC-flow components and explicit sum |
| `benchmark.toml` | One-second calibrated profile of the optimized total |

The generation request finds 19 ordered candidates, collapses them into eight
side-permutation classes, stores seven tree-level representatives, and reports
the loop-induced `g g > Z g g` class as omitted. Evaluation selects the public
ordering `d d~ > g z g`; the stored representative is reused automatically.

The three result cards use colored human tables by default. Add `--json` for
machine-readable stdout.

Use the primary Z+jet sequence, not a six-gluon card, as an installation smoke.

## Packaged scalar HEFT

Generate a full-colour Higgs-plus-two-gluon artifact without an external UFO:

```console
pyamplicol generate --card builtin_sm_heft.toml
pyamplicol inspect artifacts/builtin_sm_heft
```

The card selects the packaged `built-in-sm-heft` model and explicitly limits
the effective coupling order to `HIG = 1`. Recurrence uses the wheel-owned JIT
O2 prepared kernels. See
[Models and Processes](models-and-processes.md#built-in-scalar-heft-model) for
the compiled, eager, on-the-fly, Python API, and trusted-UFO variants.

## Three materialized execution modes on one process

The matched `Z + 6g` cards keep model, process, color accuracy, and LC layout
fixed while changing the execution mode:

```console
pyamplicol generate --card qq_z6g_recurrence_jit_o2.toml
pyamplicol profile  --card qq_z6g_recurrence_jit_o2.toml

pyamplicol generate --card qq_z6g_compiled_jit_o3.toml
pyamplicol profile  --card qq_z6g_compiled_jit_o3.toml

pyamplicol generate --card qq_z6g_eager_jit_o2.toml
pyamplicol profile  --card qq_z6g_eager_jit_o2.toml
```

Each writes a separate artifact. These are performance/acceptance workloads,
not quick examples; generation can take significant time and memory.

See [Generation Modes and Evaluators](generation-modes-and-evaluators.md) before
interpreting their differences.

## On-the-fly warm-up and profile

The OTF `p p > Z j j` example keeps generation compact, explicitly warms one
LC flow summed over helicities, and then profiles the retained workload:

```console
pyamplicol generate --card otf_pp_zjj.toml
python python/otf_pp_zjj_warm_up.py
pyamplicol profile --card otf_pp_zjj.toml
```

The Python warm-up takes exactly one double-precision phase-space point and
draws live progress while the selected family is constructed. Its colored
summary reports warm-up time, query counts, resident memory, and the matrix
element. The independent profiler then measures the configured 128-point
steady-state batch. See
[LC workloads and execution modes](lc-workloads-and-execution-modes.md#the-otf-warm-state-lifecycle)
for the cache lifecycle and native-language equivalents.

## LC selector-layout examples

The two reusable-selector cards retain complete helicity and physical-flow
coverage:

```console
pyamplicol generate --card benchmark_z6g_single_flow_helicity_sum.toml
pyamplicol profile  --card benchmark_z6g_single_flow_helicity_sum.toml

pyamplicol generate --card benchmark_z6g_all_flows_single_helicity.toml
pyamplicol profile  --card benchmark_z6g_all_flows_single_helicity.toml
```

The first uses default `topology-replay`, optimized for one selected flow and a
helicity sum. The second uses `all-flow-union`, optimized for all flows at one
selected helicity. Change selectors without regenerating:

```console
pyamplicol profile \
  --card benchmark_z6g_single_flow_helicity_sum.toml \
  --color-flow 2

pyamplicol profile \
  --card benchmark_z6g_all_flows_single_helicity.toml \
  --helicity h:-1,+1,-1,+1,+1,-1,+1,-1,+1
```

## Typed Python generation

Plan first, then generate:

```console
python python/typed_generation.py artifacts/pp_zjj_typed --plan-only
python python/typed_generation.py artifacts/pp_zjj_typed
```

The script compiles the copied serialized model, constructs explicit `p` and
`j` multiparticle definitions, and calls `Generator.plan()` or
`Generator.generate()`. The generated artifact includes the same standalone API
bundle as a CLI build.

Evaluate through the typed runtime:

```console
python python/runtime_evaluation.py \
  artifacts/pp_zjj data/pp_zjj_momenta.json \
  --process 'd d~ > g z g' \
  --parameters data/model_parameters.json \
  --set-parameter aS=0.1165
```

The JSON result reports the resolved shape and flattened values, explicit
resolved sum, optimized total, and selected physics-axis IDs.

Profile the same process:

```console
python python/benchmark.py artifacts/pp_zjj \
  --process 'd d~ > g z g' \
  --momenta data/pp_zjj_momenta.json
```

`python/external_models.py` demonstrates typed JSON and trusted-UFO
`ModelSource` construction:

```console
python python/external_models.py models/json/sm/sm.json models/ufo/sm
```

## Generated five-language API bundle

After the primary generation, run the same public process ordering in every
generated driver:

```console
python artifacts/pp_zjj/API/python/check_standalone.py \
  --process 'd d~ > g z g' --set-parameter aS 0.117 0 --json

make -C artifacts/pp_zjj/API/c run \
  ARGS='--process "d d~ > g z g" --set-parameter aS 0.117 0 --json'

make -C artifacts/pp_zjj/API/rust run \
  ARGS='--process "d d~ > g z g" --set-parameter aS 0.117 0 --precision 16 --json'

make -C artifacts/pp_zjj/API/cpp run \
  ARGS='--process "d d~ > g z g" --set-parameter aS 0.117 0 --json'

make -C artifacts/pp_zjj/API/fortran run \
  ARGS='--process "d d~ > g z g" --set-parameter aS 0.117 0 --json'
```

All drivers load one bundled point, evaluate every resolved component, sum
those components, and compare the sum to the optimized total. They use the
wheel-owned static Rusticol SDK discovered through `rusticol-config`.

Every driver also accepts `--kinematics PATH` and `--model-parameters PATH`.
The full shape, precision, ordering, and precedence rules are documented in
[Native APIs](native-apis.md) and
[Process Selection and Permutations](process-selection-and-permutations.md).

## Hand-written C++ and Fortran consumers

The `native/` directory shows SDK use independent of generated driver sources:

```console
make -C native
native/runtime_cpp artifacts/pp_zjj p_p_to_z_j_j_4 \
  data/model_parameters.json
native/runtime_fortran artifacts/pp_zjj p_p_to_z_j_j_4 \
  data/model_parameters.json
```

Both programs apply an `aS` override, evaluate one five-particle point, and
verify that resolved components reproduce the total.

## Modify an example safely

Prefer a new output directory when changing execution mode, backend, color
accuracy, or flow layout:

```console
pyamplicol generate \
  --card benchmark_z6g_single_flow_helicity_sum.toml \
  --execution-mode eager \
  --set generation.output=artifacts/uubar_z6g_eager_experiment
```

Use `--set generation.mode=replace` only when you explicitly want to replace
an existing artifact transactionally.
