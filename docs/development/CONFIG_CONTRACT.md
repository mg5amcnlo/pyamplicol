# Configuration Contract

TOML schema version 1 and the Python configuration dataclasses share one field
registry. Unknown fields are errors. Paths are resolved relative to the card.

Precedence is defaults, card, dedicated CLI flags, repeatable `--set`
overrides in order, then recorded license/resource clamping.

## Top Level

- `schema_version: int = 1`
- `action: generate | evaluate | benchmark | inspect | model-inspect |
  model-compile | model-processes`

## Model

- `source: str = "built-in-sm"`
- `restriction: str | null`
- `simplify: bool = true`
- `cache: bool = true`
- `cache_dir: path | null`

## Process

- `entries: list[{ expression: str, name: str | null }]`
- `multiparticles: table[str, list[str]] = {}`
- `flavor_scheme: int = 5`
- `max_quark_lines: int | null`
- `coupling_order_policy: minimal | explicit = minimal`
- `max_coupling_orders: table[str, int] = {}`
- `max_color_sectors: int | null`
- `reference_color_order: list[int] = []`
- `selected_color_sector_ids: list[int] = []`
- `selected_source_helicities: table[int, int] = {}`

Model defaults and this explicit table are merged by name. Every model supplies
`all` for its declaration-ordered valid physical external states; an explicit
`all` entry overrides it. Broad products such as `p p > all all` may expand
combinatorially.

The explicit color-sector, reference-order, and source-helicity controls are
developer-facing generation constraints. Ordinary users should leave them at
their defaults and use the runtime selectors below.

## Color

- `accuracy: lc | nlc | full = lc`
- `contraction: auto | direct | symmetric-group-fft = auto`
- `fft_basis: trace | adjoint = adjoint`
- `lc_flow_layout: topology-replay | all-flow-union = topology-replay`

LC generation always includes complete physical flow coverage. Runtime flow
selectors are configured under `evaluation` or `benchmark`; internal sector,
topology, replay, and reference-order IDs are not configurable.

`symmetric-group-fft` is an exact contracted-colour reducer for NLC/full
recurrence and on-the-fly execution. It is rejected for LC, compiled, and eager
execution when explicitly requested. The default `auto` tries FFT in the
supported lanes, falling back to direct for unsupported process plans; LC,
compiled/eager, and correlated generation use direct contraction and trace
basis. Explicit `direct` opts out and ignores `fft_basis`.

`fft_basis = "adjoint"` requests adaptive exact-basis selection with
`contraction = "auto"` or `"symmetric-group-fft"`. Certified Yang–Mills trees and
certified single-insertion scalar HEFT (`HIG = 1`) use two-anchor DDM; quark processes
retain fundamental chains or their products, and uncertified adjoint domains
retain trace tensors. Singlet domains have one trivial tensor. This does not
add a JO primitive decomposition or assume identities for arbitrary models.
Forced adjoint FFT remains unsupported for correlated generation.

For `n` gluons, DDM retains `(n-2)!` ordered amplitudes instead of `(n-1)!`;
its two-adjoint endpoint case is the single delta tensor. Saved
`fft_basis_selection` contains `requested`, `actual_basis`, `name`, `reason`,
`permutation_degree`, and `tensor_count`. `actual_basis` selects the metric
implementation (`trace` or `adjoint`); `name` distinguishes DDM, fundamental
chains/products, singlets, and trace tensors. Counts exclude open-line
traversal aliases and do not assert linear independence at fixed `Nc`.

The CLI `--fft {trace,adjoint}` sets both contraction and basis request without
changing accuracy. Explicit FFT requests retain unsupported-plan errors;
`--color-contraction symmetric-group-fft` uses adjoint by default.
`ColorFFTBasis` and `ColorConfig` are public Python exports. Examples
select the adaptive adjoint option explicitly without implying that every
process has a smaller basis or faster runtime.

## Generation

- `output: path | null`
- `mode: error | append | replace = error`
- `workers: auto | int = auto`
- `emit_api_bundle: bool = true`

### Generation Validation

- `enabled: bool = true`
- `samples: int = 2`
- `seed: int = 12345`
- `relative_tolerance: float = 1e-12`
- `absolute_tolerance: float = 1e-300`
- `post_build_validation: bool = false`

### Relation Discovery

- `mode: off | diagnostic | certified-reuse = off`
- `precision_digits: int >= 80 = 96`
- `probe_count: int >= 2 = 4`
- `verification_probe_count: int >= 2 = 4`
- `relative_tolerance: float >= 0 = 1e-70`
- `absolute_tolerance: float >= 0 = 1e-80`
- `seed: int >= 0 = 1348026701`

Candidate and independent verification probes are bounded and deterministic.
Artifact writing always validates the schema, declared payloads, references,
and digests. Optional post-build validation additionally re-opens the completed
artifact and compares native binary64 optimized and resolved evaluation. It is
off by default because that second runtime pass does not alter the artifact and
can be disproportionately expensive for large resolved axes; enable it with
`--post-build-validation` when an immediate runtime smoke is wanted. Its
configured samples are independent of the 96-digit relation-discovery
certification probes below.
Exact binary64 term-vector or `ExactComplexRational` schedule proofs remain the
preferred promotion path. When no exact structural proof exists,
`certified-reuse` may apply equal, opposite, or zero-current reuse only after
the independent current-value probes pass both configured tolerances and the
complete certification input and mapping are persisted for replay. One warning
is emitted per generated artifact when such proof-less mappings are applied.
Malformed, non-finite, unstable, or stale evidence fails closed.

The feature is off by default: its high-precision probes evaluate the complete
current schedule several times at generation time, which dominates the build at
high multiplicity. `mode = "certified-reuse"`—or the public
`--numerical-current-reuse` flag—enables it for LC, NLC, and full colour, for
compiled, eager, and recurrence generation using built-in or prepared
external/UFO models, to search for additional equal, opposite, or zero-current
reuse. The compact on-the-fly source projection does not run this configurable
relation-discovery pass. `mode = "off"`—or `--no-numerical-current-reuse`—
restates the default and never changes numerical results. Direct vertex-kernel
equivalence remains model-certificate-owned.

## Evaluator

- `backend: jit | asm | cpp = jit`
- `execution_mode: compiled | eager | recurrence | on-the-fly = recurrence`
- `batch_size: int = 128`
- `output_chunk_size: int | null = 512`
- Stage-local parameter layout is mandatory and is not a public toggle.

### Eager Execution

- `point_tile_size: int = 1024`
- `workspace_mib: int = 256` (soft batching target)

Eager mode requires a prepared model bundle before DAG construction. A
`built-in-sm` source resolves automatically to the wheel-owned portable
`built-in-sm-jit-o2` pack; other models and built-in C++/ASM execution require
an explicit prepared path. The prepared pack is
authoritative for backend and code-shaping optimization settings. The runtime
may reduce `point_tile_size` to approach the workspace target, but never
increases it. The target does not reject a process whose minimum workspace
is larger: at least one point is always allowed, with sufficient allocation.

`.pyAmplicol-model.json` IR is architecture-independent. SymJIT application
storage-v3 prepared packs use optimization level 2 and are portable across the
supported `x86_64` and `aarch64` targets. Loading rebuilds executable code for
the receiving CPU. Prepared-pack compilation forces O2 and records any
requested-to-effective adjustment. C++ and ASM prepared packs remain
target-native.

### Recurrence Execution

- `point_tile_size: int = 1024`
- `workspace_mib: int = 256` (soft batching target)

Recurrence is the global default. The runtime may reduce `point_tile_size` to
approach the recurrence workspace target, but never increases it. Like eager
execution, it allocates at least the workspace needed for one point, even when
that exceeds the target. A strict total-memory limit belongs to an external
watchdog, not to the generated process. Recurrence JIT
kernels use the same portable prepared O2 contract as eager execution. A
missing prepared pack fails closed; configuration resolution never falls back
to compiled execution. Cards that require process-local compiled DAGs must set
`execution_mode = "compiled"` explicitly.

### On-The-Fly Execution

On-the-fly execution requires a prepared model bundle and native `f64`
precision. It stores a compact process seed and constructs recurrence schedules
for the requested selector instead of materializing a process layout. LC does
not materialize topology replay or all-flow union: static inspection exposes
the physical helicity/color-flow census and the runtime supplies both selector
families. NLC and full colour expose one contracted component, accept helicity
selectors, and reject LC-flow selectors.

`evaluator.optimization.cores` resolves to a positive requested
query-construction thread count for this mode. It is not a numerical-runtime
thread guarantee. LC numerical execution sizes its warmed family to the
requested batch capacity. Contracted NLC/full execution applies the
authenticated recurrence point tile. There is no on-the-fly-specific tile or
workspace configuration section.

### Evaluator Optimization

- `horner_iterations: int = 10`
- `cpe_iterations: int | null = null`
- `cores: auto | int = auto`
- `max_horner_variables: int = 1000`
- `max_common_pair_cache_entries: int = 5000000`
- `max_common_pair_distance: int = 1000`
- `collect_factors: auto | bool = auto`

For on-the-fly execution, only `cores` has a mode-specific runtime meaning;
the prepared kernel pack remains authoritative for code-shaping optimization.

### JIT

- `optimization_level: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 = 2`
- `compress: AutoBool = "auto"` (compiled JIT O2 resolves to `true`; all other
  modes/levels resolve to `false`; explicit booleans override the default)

JIT artifacts embed direct SymJIT applications. The defaults above apply to
process-local compiled DAG evaluators. Prepared JIT kernel packs used by eager,
recurrence, and on-the-fly execution force optimization level 2 to preserve
their cross-architecture storage contract.

Compression can reduce generated code size but add runtime overhead. Auto
selection remains in requested configuration; effective configuration records
the resolved boolean. Explicit settings remain authoritative for newly
compiled kernels; existing prepared packs retain their recorded setting.

### C++

- `optimization: str = "O3"`
- `compiler: str | null`
- `native_arch: bool = false`
- `extra_flags: list[str] = []`

Portable C++ generation is the default. Setting `native_arch = true` opts into
host-native code and records Rusticol's canonical, sorted runtime CPU-feature set
as an artifact requirement. Loaders reject that artifact before reading evaluator
state on a target without every declared feature. Additional flags are restricted
to the documented non-ISA allowlist; arbitrary `-march`, `-mcpu`, `-m*`, or target
flags are rejected because they could introduce unrecorded requirements.
Schema-v3 evaluator payload portability is currently defined for macOS arm64,
macOS x86_64, and glibc Linux x86_64. Other targets are rejected explicitly.

## Evaluation

- `artifact: path | null`
- `process: str | null`
- `precision: int = 16`
- `resolved: bool = false`
- `helicity_ids: list[str] = []`
- `color_flow_ids: list[str] = []`
- `model_parameters: path | null`
- `momenta: path | null`

## Benchmark

- `target_runtime: float = 10.0`
- `batch_size: int = 128`
- `precision: int = 16`
- `warmup_runs: int = 2`
- `minimum_samples: int = 5`
- `helicity_ids: list[str] = []`
- `color_flow_ids: list[str] = []`

For LC profiling, empty benchmark selector lists resolve at runtime to the
generated layout's optimized workload: one physical flow and the helicity sum
for `topology-replay`, or all physical flows and one computed helicity for
`all-flow-union`. Explicit subsets and selected-axis lists are preserved; a
complete summed-axis list is normalized to equivalent omission. A valid
non-hot shape emits at most one pre-loop warning per loaded process. Evaluation
selector defaults remain the complete matrix element.

## Output And Symbolica

- `output.format: human | json = human` for typed API/config provenance. The
  public CLI normalizes this to human tables unless `--json` is explicitly
  present.
- `output.color: auto | always | never = auto`
- `output.progress: auto | tty | log | off = auto`
- `output.log_level: debug | info | warning | error = info`
- `symbolica.suggest_license: bool = true`
